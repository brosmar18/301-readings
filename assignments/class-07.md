## What is Node.js
A platform or environment that allows you to run JS code on your computer's server, rather than just a web browser. Before Node.js, JS was mainly used for building and running scripts on web pages to make them more interactive. With Node.js, developers can now use JS to create server-side applications, like web servers or APIs, and perform other tasks that were previously limited to other programming languages like Python.

## What is Chrome's V8 JS Engine?
A piece of software that's used to execute JS code inside the Google Chrome web browser. It's called an engine because it's responsible for converting the JS code you write into a format that your computer can understand and run.

## What does it mean that Node is a JS runtime?
A JS runtime refers to the environment or platform where JS code is executed. When we say that Node is a JS runtime, it means that it provides a set of tools, libraries, and features that allow developers to run JS code outside of a web browser. This expands the capabilities of JS, enabling it to be used for a broader range of tasks, like building server-side applications.

## What is `npm`?
npm, which stands for Node Package Manager, is a tool that comes with Node.js. It helps developers easily manage and share reusable pieces of code packages or modules. These packages can be installed and used in your own projects, saving you time and effort by not having too reinvent the wheel. npm also makes it easy to keep your packages up-to-date, and manage dependencies (other packages your project relies on).

## What version of Node.js and npm are running on your machine?
Run commands: node -v. and npm -v.

## What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint'?
To install a package called `jshint` using npm, open the terminal and type the following command: `npm install -g jshint`.

This command tells npm to install the ‘jshint' package globally, meaning it will be available for all projects on your machine. If you want to install it for a specific project, navigate to the project’s root foder in the terminal and use this command instead: `npm install --save-dev jshint`.

## What is node used for?
Node.js is mainly used for building server-side apps and tools using jS. Common uses include:

- Creating web servers and APIs: Node.js allows you to build backend services for web apps, handling requests from clients and serving up data files.
- Developing real-time applications: With its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, Node.js is well-suited for building real-time apps like chat applications, online gaming servers, or live data feeds.
- Building command-line tools: Node.js can be used to create command-line utilities and scripts that help automate.
