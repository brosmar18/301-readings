## Who is Roy Fielding?
Roy Fielding is a computer scientist who is best known for his contributions to the World Wide Web. He is the primary author of the HTTP specification and the founder of the Apache HTTP Server project, which is one of the most widely used web servers on the internet.
## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
The techniques used in this class are primarily focused on building applications that communicate with a single server or API. However, when we need to communicate with all the machines in the world, we need to use a more standardized and scalable aproach like RESTful APIs.
## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
The HTTP protocol is the foundation of communication on the World Wide Web. It is a standardized set of rules that define how information is exechanged between web servers and clients.
## What does a GET do?
A GET request is a method used to retrieve info from a sever. When a client sends a GET request, it is asking the server to return a specific resource, such as a web page, a document, or a piece of data.
## What does a POST do?
A POST request is used to submit data to a sever. When a client sends a POST request, it is typically sending data to be stored or processed by the server. For example, when you fill out a form on a website and click the "submit" button, a POST request is sent to the sever with the data you entered.
## What does PUT do?
A PUT request is used to update an existing resource on the sever. When a client sends a PUT request, it is typically updating data that already exists on the sever. For example, if you were editing a blog post, you might send a PUT request to update the content of the post.
## What does PATCH do?
A PATCH request is similar to a PUT request, but iti is used to make partial updates to a resource rather than replacing the entire resource. This can be useful when you only need to update a small piece of data, rather than sending the entire resource back to the server.
