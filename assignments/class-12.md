We need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our sever and put it into our `.env` to enhance security and maintainability. Storing sensitive info like database connections strings in a `.env` file prevents accidental exposure of the credentials in the codebase or version control systems, and it allows for easy configuration changes without modifying the code itself.
