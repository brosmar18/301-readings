# Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

- What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science? 
The decline of women in computer science coincided with the rise of personal computers in the 1980s. These machines were primarily marketed towards boys and men, perpetuating the stereotype of computing as a masculine domain.

- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
The fact that males grew up playing with computers matters because it afforded them early exposure and familiarity with technology, providing an advantage in the increasingly digital world. This trend has inadvertently contributed to a gender gap in computer science, reinforcing stereotypes and exacerbating barriers for women in the field.
- When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are most successful when they are comprehensive, sustained, and deeply ingrained into the fabric of an organization. They require not only a focus on recruitment but also an emphasis on creating an inclusive and equitable environment that values and nurtures diverse talents and perspectives.
- Why do diverse companies perform better?
Diverse companies perform better because they bring together a wider range of ideas, experiences, and perspectives, enhancing problem-solving and decision-making.
- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa. 
Consider a global tech company with a diverse workforce representing different nationalities, languages, and cultures. This diversity enables the company to understand and cater to the unique needs of its global user base more effectively.
